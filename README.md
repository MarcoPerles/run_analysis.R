1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# for both Activity and Subject files this will merge the training and the test sets by row binding 
#and rename variables "subject" and "activityNum"
alldataSubject <- rbind(dataSubjectTrain, dataSubjectTest)
setnames(alldataSubject, "V1", "subject")
alldataActivity<- rbind(dataActivityTrain, dataActivityTest)
setnames(alldataActivity, "V1", "activityNum")

#combine the DATA training and test files
dataTable <- rbind(dataTrain, dataTest)

# name variables according to feature e.g.(V1 = "tBodyAcc-mean()-X")
dataFeatures <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "features.txt")))
setnames(dataFeatures, names(dataFeatures), c("featureNum", "featureName"))
colnames(dataTable) <- dataFeatures$featureName

#column names for activity labels
activityLabels<- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "activity_labels.txt")))
setnames(activityLabels, names(activityLabels), c("activityNum","activityName"))

# Merge columns
alldataSubjAct<- cbind(alldataSubject, alldataActivity)
dataTable <- cbind(alldataSubjAct, dataTable)



2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# Reading "features.txt" and extracting only the mean and standard deviation
dataFeaturesMeanStd <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)",dataFeatures$featureName,value=TRUE) #var name

# Taking only measurements for the mean and standard deviation and add "subject","activityNum"

dataFeaturesMeanStd <- union(c("subject","activityNum"), dataFeaturesMeanStd)
dataTable<- subset(dataTable,select=dataFeaturesMeanStd) 



3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
##enter name of activity into dataTable
dataTable <- merge(activityLabels, dataTable , by="activityNum", all.x=TRUE)
dataTable$activityName <- as.character(dataTable$activityName)

## create dataTable with variable means sorted by subject and Activity
dataTable$activityName <- as.character(dataTable$activityName)
dataAggr<- aggregate(. ~ subject - activityName, data = dataTable, mean) 
dataTable<- tbl_df(arrange(dataAggr,subject,activityName))



4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
Body = related to body movement.
Gravity = acceleration of gravity
Acc = accelerometer measurement
Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
Mag = magnitude of movement
mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements. The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.


names(dataTable)<-gsub("std()", "SD", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("mean()", "MEAN", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("^t", "time", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("^f", "frequency", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(dataTable))



5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
##write to text file on disk
write.table(dataTable, "TidyData.txt", row.name=FALSE)
