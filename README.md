1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

For both Activity and Subject files this will merge the training and the test sets by row binding and rename variables "subject" and "activityNum"

alldataSubject <- rbind(dataSubjectTrain, dataSubjectTest)
setnames(alldataSubject, "V1", "subject")
alldataActivity<- rbind(dataActivityTrain, dataActivityTest)
setnames(alldataActivity, "V1", "activityNum")

Combine the DATA training and test files

dataTable <- rbind(dataTrain, dataTest)

Name variables according to feature e.g.(V1 = "tBodyAcc-mean()-X")

dataFeatures <- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "features.txt")))
setnames(dataFeatures, names(dataFeatures), c("featureNum", "featureName"))
colnames(dataTable) <- dataFeatures$featureName

Column names for activity labels

activityLabels<- tbl_df(read.table(file.path(filesPath, "activity_labels.txt")))
setnames(activityLabels, names(activityLabels), c("activityNum","activityName"))

Merge columns

alldataSubjAct<- cbind(alldataSubject, alldataActivity)
dataTable <- cbind(alldataSubjAct, dataTable)



2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Reading "features.txt" and extracting only the mean and standard deviation

dataFeaturesMeanStd <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)",dataFeatures$featureName,value=TRUE) #var name

Taking only measurements for the mean and standard deviation and add "subject","activityNum"

dataFeaturesMeanStd <- union(c("subject","activityNum"), dataFeaturesMeanStd)
dataTable<- subset(dataTable,select=dataFeaturesMeanStd) 



Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, enter name of activity into dataTable

dataTable <- merge(activityLabels, dataTable , by="activityNum", all.x=TRUE)
dataTable$activityName <- as.character(dataTable$activityName)

Create dataTable with variable means sorted by subject and Activity

dataTable$activityName <- as.character(dataTable$activityName)
dataAggr<- aggregate(. ~ subject - activityName, data = dataTable, mean) 
dataTable<- tbl_df(arrange(dataAggr,subject,activityName))



Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
Body = related to body movement.
Gravity = acceleration of gravity
Acc = accelerometer measurement
Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
Mag = magnitude of movement
Mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements. The units given are gâ€™s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.


names(dataTable)<-gsub("std()", "SD", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("mean()", "MEAN", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("^t", "time", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("^f", "frequency", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(dataTable))
names(dataTable)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(dataTable))



From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

write.table(dataTable, "TidyData.txt", row.name=FALSE)
